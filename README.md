# Maquetacion-Ford

## Project Overview

This project is a static landing page for Ford, created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The main objective of this project is to practice and enhance my web development skills as part of my studies in Web Application Development (Desarrollo de Aplicaciones Web - DAW). The page replicates the design and layout of Ford's official website, focusing on structure, styling, and basic interactivity.

## Features

- **Static Layout**: The page features a fixed layout without responsive design elements.
- **HTML & CSS**: The structure and styling are implemented using HTML5 and CSS3, with an emphasis on clean and semantic code.
- **JavaScript**: Basic interactivity, such as event handling, is managed using vanilla JavaScript.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
- **JavaScript (ES6)**
